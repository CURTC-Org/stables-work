## IMPORTANT ‚ö†Ô∏è

- If you are banned from the revamped version of Clean Up RTC for using this repository please friend me on Discord (@stablestream).
- All assets available here are OLD. I won't fix any bugs related to anything in this repository.

## Overview

All work created by me for Clean Up RTC, released as open-source and free for you to use in any project (under the Mozilla Public Licence or European Union Public Licence v1.1) you're working on, whether personal, educational, or commercial. You are welcome to modify, distribute, and integrate this work into your own open-source projects. Feel free to adapt it to your needs, share it with others, or build upon it.

## Why is some stuff missing?

This repository includes all stuff I made, and not the whole game, meaning it contains basic stuff like the hyperlaser gun, the map, the shop, the partner program and more, but it also might not include minor details such as swords in the entrance or minigames ( no one played those tbh so yeah üíîüíî ).

## Why is this repository becoming public and not private? Doesn't 2code own the rights?

uh well needless to explain, he doesnt own them anymore and i thought its funny to upload them here so i hope you enjoy them lol.

## What are my rights? How can I use the open-source material?

You can view your rights by searching the name of the licence the work comes with. Most of the material will carry a 'Mozilla Public Licence (MPL)' licence, and some of it might carry a 'EUPL-1.1 (European Union Public Licence v1.1)' licence.
